# GrooveStats Auto Pack Downloader

This tool is not official but takes pack list off the GrooveStats using web scraping while being considerate of the server's resources.


# Platforms Supported

Tested on Windows, hasnt' been tested on Linux. But ideally any platform that can install Rust should work. Mac OS X and above will currently not be supported until Linux has been tested and working like on Windows. But feel free to fork this project its open source after all.
