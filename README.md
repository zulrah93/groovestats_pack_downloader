# GrooveStats Auto Pack Downloader

This tool is not official but takes pack list off the GrooveStats using web scraping while being considerate of the server's resources.


# Platforms Supported

Tested on Windows, hasnt' been tested on Linux or Mac OS. But ideally any platform that can install Rust should work.
